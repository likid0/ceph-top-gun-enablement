= Ceph RadosGW Opslog configuration

== Enable Opslog in RGW

First thing we need to do is adding the following options in our ceph database
configuration

* *rgw_enable_ops_log:* Enable/Disable rgw_ops_log.
* *rgw_ops_log_rados:* Whether the operations log should be written to
the Ceph Storage Cluster backend.
the following HTTP headers:
* *rgw_ops_log_socket_path:* Socket path where Ceph RadosGW `ops_log`
will be stored.

We add the options to the client.rgw ceph database configuration, and restart
the RGW instances

....
# ceph config set client.rgw rgw_enable_ops_log true
# ceph config set client.rgw rgw_ops_log_rados false
# ceph config set client.rgw rgw_ops_log_socket_path /var/run/ceph/opslog
# ceph config dump | grep client.rgw
    client.rgw                                   advanced  rgw_enable_ops_log                     true
    client.rgw                                   advanced  rgw_ops_log_rados                      false
    client.rgw                                   advanced  rgw_ops_log_socket_path                /var/run/ceph/opslog
# ceph orch ls | grep rgw.objectgw
rgw.objectgw               ?:8080           1/1  3m ago     2h   count:1;label:rgw
# ceph orch restart rgw.objectgw
Scheduled to restart rgw.objectgw.ceph-mon02.hxvmmy on host 'ceph-mon02'
....

NOTE: the path we selected for the socket is inside the container
`/var/run/ceph/opslog` , on the host it translates to `/var/run/ceph/$CLUSTERFSID/opslog`


Let's create a bucket and copy a file to generate some operations for the
opslog to capture

----
#  aws --endpoint http://ceph-mon02:8080 s3 mb s3://demobucket --region default
make_bucket: demobucket
#  aws --endpoint http://ceph-mon02:8080 s3 cp /etc/hosts s3://demobucket/
upload: ../etc/hosts to s3://demobucket/hosts 
----

Connect to the node where the RGW daemon is running, in our case `ceph-mon02`,
to check our RadosGW ops log socket.

On the opslog we have both actions log, creating the bucket `demobucket` and
uploading a file to the bucket

....
# dnf install nc -y
# nc -U --recv-only  /var/run/ceph/274ba756-91d7-11ed-aa4c-2cc260754989/opslog

Currently, RadosGW `ops_log` is stored in a socket. We would like to
send these logs to a file in our server or even to log aggregation server. 

As a workaround until the feature described above is implemented, we can:

* Create a systemd unit:

----
# vim /etc/systemd/system/rgwopslog.service
[Unit]
Description=RGW opslog
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'until ss -lnt |grep 8080; do sleep 1; done;'
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/nc -U  --recv-only /var/run/ceph/274ba756-91d7-11ed-aa4c-2cc260754989/opslog >> /var/log/ceph/274ba756-91d7-11ed-aa4c-2cc260754989/rgwops.log"
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

* Create a task to rotate the opslog:

----
# vim /etc/logrotate.d/opslogs
/var/log/ceph/274ba756-91d7-11ed-aa4c-2cc260754989/rgwops.log {
  su ceph ceph
  rotate 4
  daily
  dateext
  compress
  postrotate
    systemctl restart rgwopslog
  endscript
  missingok
  notifempty
}
----

Lets test the configuration forcing a log rotation in debug mode

----
# logrotate  -d -f  /etc/logrotate.d/opslogs
rotating pattern: /var/log/ceph/274ba756-91d7-11ed-aa4c-2cc260754989/rgwops.log  forced from command line (4 rotations)

compressing log with: /bin/gzip

----

*NOTE:* The RadosGW `ops_log` can become quickly very big, thus if there
is a concern about the space usage in the system we recommend to rotate
the RadosGW `ops_log` based on the file size.

*NOTE:* Even when using STS temporary tokens assuming roles, the
`ops_log` is able to identify and log the original user starting the
transaction, not the temportal token itself.
