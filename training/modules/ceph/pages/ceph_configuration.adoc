= Ceph Confguration Parameters

Every Ceph daemon, process, and library accesses its configuration from one of these sources:
* The compiled-in default value
* The centralized configuration database
* Configuration file that is stored on the local host

== Ceph Configuration Sections

Ceph organizes configuration settings into groups, whether stored in the configuration file or in
the configuration database, using sections called for the daemons or clients to which they apply.

* The [global] section stores general configuration that is common to all daemons or any
process that reads the configuration, including clients. You can override [global] parameters
by creating called sections for individual daemons or clients.
* The [mon] section stores configuration for the Monitors (MON).
* The [osd] section stores configuration for the OSD daemons.
* The [mgr] section stores configuration for the Managers (MGR).
* The [mds] section stores configuration for the Metadata Servers (MDS).
* The [client] section stores configuration that applies to all the Ceph clients.


== Using the Ceph centralized configuration database

The MON cluster manages and stores the centralized configuration database on the MON nodes.
You can either change a setting temporarily, until the daemons restart, or configure a setting
permanently and store it in the database. You can change most configuration settings while the
cluster is running.

Use ceph config commands to query the database and view configuration information.
* ceph config ls, to list all possible configuration settings.
* ceph config help setting, for help with a particular configuration setting.
* ceph config dump, to show the cluster configuration database settings.
* ceph config show $type.$id, to show the database settings for a specific daemon. Use
show-with-defaults to include default settings.
* ceph config get $type.$id, to get a specific configuration setting.
* ceph config set $type.$id, to set a specific configuration setting.
