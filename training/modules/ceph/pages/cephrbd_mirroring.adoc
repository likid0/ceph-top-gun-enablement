== Introduction

Ceph supports mirroring RBD Images for any purpose you can see fit, the major
one being disaster recovery. However the mirroring implmentation took different
options and are specific to the environment (client side) consuming the Ceph
cluster.

WARNING: Both existing RBD mirroring implementation are asynchronous

== Architecture

The RBD asynchronous mirroring are performed by adding a new daemon to the
Ceph cluster. This daemon is known as the `rbd-mirror` daemon.

In the RBD Mirroring architecture, the `rbd-mirror` daemon is usually deployed
in the cluster that will receive the mirror of the RBD Image.

The RBD Images that get mirrored are controlled by the following option:

* A Mirror pair of clusters must be first defined
** The clusters in a pair are known as peer clusters
* Pool mode mirrroring: All new images created in the pool get mirrored
* Image mode mirroring: Only the images explicitely set in the pool get mirrored

To enable pool mode mirroring, use  `rbd mirror pool enable {pool-name} {mode}`
where `{mode}` can be:

* `pool` to enable pool mode mirroring
* `image` to enable image mode mirroring

NOTE: Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation uses `image` mode.

To disable miroring use `rbd mirror pool disable {pool-name}`

When using `image` mode mirroring, you must explicitely name the RBD Images that
are mirrored between the two clusters.

NOTE: When using Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Regional DR the `RamenDR`
pods will toggle the mirroring flag on the RBD Images automatically.

To create a pair of peer cluster you must use the `rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap create [--site-name {local-site-name}] {pool-name}`
command. This command will create a bootstrap token which can then be imported in the
remote cluster via the `rbd mirror pool peer bootstrap import [--site-name {local-site-name}] [--direction {rx-only or rx-tx}] {pool-name} {token-path}` command.

NOTE: You can also manually peer the cluster by copying the remote cluster
`cephx` credentials on the machine where the `rbd` command will be used.

To enable mirroring of an image, use the `rbd mirror image enable {pool-name}/{image-name} {mode}` command.
`{mode} can be set to:

* `snapshot` to enable snapshot based mirroring
* `journal` to enable journal based mirroring

NOTE: See subsequent chapters for the differebces between the two modes.

WARNING: When operating a standalone Ceph cluster the RBD Mirroring parameters
must be applied to each cluster.

== Journal based mirroring

This is the oldest RBD Mirroring technology that was implemented for OpenStack.
It is compatible only with `librbd` based clients in environments such as
OpenStack and Proxmox.

IMPORTANT: This mode is not compatible with `krbd` hence not compatible
with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation as of today.

The journal based mirroring follows the following steps:

* Client issues a write against the RBD Image
* `librbd` writes the IO to the RBD Image
* `librbd` writes the IO to the RBD journal
* `librbd` acknowledges the IO to the client

As the journal gets written, the `rbd-mirror` daemon picks up the IO
from the RBD journal and mirrors the IO onto the remote RBD Image.

WARNING: As the RBD Images are identical between the 2 clusters, writing to the
remote RBD Image will also cause 2 writes; One to the RBD Image, one to the RBD
Image journal.

== Snapshot based mirroring

This mirroring method is compatible with both kernel RBD client and `librbd` clients.
It is the solution implemented for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Regional DR
capabilities.

Once you have enabled RBD Mirroring `snapshot` mode for the image, you have
to configure the snapshot scheduling for the RBD Image. This schedule defines
how often a snapshot of the RBD Image is taken so that the snapshot can be
mirrored to the target Ceph cluster.

To create a schedule, use the `rbd mirror snapshot schedule add [--pool {pool-name}] [--image {image-name}] {interval} [{start-time}]`
command. The interval can be specified in days, hours, or minutes using `d`, `h`, `m`
suffix respectively. The optional start-time can be specified using the ISO 8601 time format.

To list existing schedules for a RBD Image use `rbd mirror schedule ls --pool {pool-name} --recursive`.

To view the status of an existing schedule, use `rbd mirror snapshot schedule status [--pool {pool-name}] [--image {image-name}]`
to view when the next snapshot will be taken for the RBD Image.

WARNING: Make sure to allow for enough time between 2 snapshot for the entire
content of the snapshot to be replicated between the two clusters.
