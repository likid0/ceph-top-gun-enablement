== Overview

Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) is an open-source enterprise platform that provides
unified software-defined storage on standard, economical servers and disks.With block, object, and file storage combined into one platform, Red Hat Ceph Storage efficiently and automatically manages all your data, so you can focus on the applications and workloads that use it.


This guide, will explain how to properly set up a Red Hat Ceph Storage 5 cluster deployed on two different datacenters using the stretched mode functionality.


Also, RHCS provides other advanced characteristics like:

- Decouples software from hardware to run cost-effectively on industry-standard servers and disks.
- Scales flexibly and massively to support multiple petabyte deployments with consistent performance.
- Provides web-scale object storage for modern use cases, such as cloud infrastructure, media repository, and big data analytics.
- Combines the most stable version of Ceph with a storage management console, deployment tools, and support services.
- Object, block, and file storage.
- Compatibility with Amazon S3 object application programming interface (API), OpenStack Swift, NFS v4, or native API protocols.
- Block storage integrated with OpenStack, Linux, and KVM hypervisor.
- Validated with Apache Hadoop S3A filesystem client.
- Multi-site and disaster recovery options.
- Flexible storage policies.
- Data durability via erasure coding or replication.



In the diagram depicted below, we can see a graphical representation of the RHCS
architecture that will be used in this guide:


image::RHCS-stretch-cluster-arbiter.png[High-Level Architecture RHCS stretch mode]

== RHCS stretch mode introduction

When the stretch mode is enabled, the OSDs will only take PGs active when they peer across datacenters, assuming both are alive with the following constraints:


* Pools will increase in size from the default 3 to 4, expecting two copies on each site.
* OSDs will only be allowed to connect to monitors in the same datacenter.
* New monitors will not join the cluster if they do not specify a location.


If all the OSDs and monitors from a datacenter become inaccessible at once, the surviving datacenter will enter a degraded stretch mode which implies:

* This will issue a warning, reduce the pool's `min_size` to 1, and allow the cluster to go active with data in the remaining site.
* The pool `size` parameter is not changed, so you will also get warnings that the pools are too small.
* Although, the stretch mode flag will prevent the OSDs from creating extra copies in the remaining datacenter (so it will only keep two copies, as before).

When the missing datacenter comes back, the cluster will enter recovery stretch mode triggering the following actions:

* This changes the warning and allows peering but still only requires OSDs from the datacenter, which was up the whole time.
* When all PGs are in a known state and are neither degraded nor incomplete, the cluster transitions back to the regular stretch mode where:

** The cluster ends the warning.
** Restores `min_size` to its starting value (2) and requires both sites to peer.
** Stops requiring the always-alive site when peering (so that you can failover to the other site, if necessary).



== Requirements for deploying Red Hat Ceph Storage stretch cluster with arbiter

Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) is an open-source enterprise platform that provides unified software-defined storage on standard, economical servers and disks. With block, object, and file storage combined into one platform, Red Hat Ceph Storage efficiently and automatically manages all your data, so you can focus on the applications and workloads that use it.

This section provides a basic overview of the RHCS deployment. For more complex
deployment, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5[official documentation guide for RHCS 5.]

NOTE: Only Flash media is supported since it runs with `min_size=1` when degraded. Use stretch mode only with all-flash OSDs. Using all-flash OSDs minimizes the time needed to recover once connectivity is restored, thus minimizing the potential for data loss. Erasure coded pools cannot be used with stretch mode.

WARNING: Erasure coded pools cannot be used with stretch mode.

NOTE: Custom CRUSH rules providing two copies in each site (using 4 copies) must be created when configuring the stretch mode in the Ceph cluster.

=== Software Details

Use the latest software version of RHCS 5. See
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1548993[the knowledgebase article on
Red Hat Ceph Storage: Supported configurations.] 


=== Network Configurations

The recommended Red Hat Ceph Storage configuration is as follows:
You must have two separate networks, one public network and one private network.
You must have three different datacenters with L2 or L3 connectivity between all the nodes that form the Ceph cluster.

NOTE: You can use different subnets for each of the datacenters.

Here is an example of a basic network configuration that we have used in this guide:

* **DC1:** **Ceph public/private network:** 10.40.0.0/24
* **DC2:** **Ceph public/private network:** 10.40.0.0/24
* **DC3:** **Ceph public/private network:** 10.40.0.0/24

For more information on the required network environment, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html/configuration_guide/ceph-network-configuration[Ceph
network configuration.]


== Node Pre-Deployment Requirements

Before installing the RHCS Ceph cluster, we need to perform the following steps to fulfil all the requirements needed:


=== Repositories and packages

. Register all the nodes to the Red Hat Network or Red Hat Satellite and subscribe to a valid pool:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
subscription-manager register
subscription-manager subscribe --pool=8a8XXXXXX9e0
....
--
+
. All nodes in the Ceph cluster need access to the following repositories:
+
--
* `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms`
* `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms`
[source,role="execute"]
....
subscription-manager repos --disable="*" --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms"
....
--
+
. Update the Operating system RPMs to the latest version and reboot if needed:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
dnf update -y
reboot
....

--
+
. Select a node from the cluster to be your bootstrap node. `ceph1` is our
bootstrap node in this example going forward.
+
Only on the bootstrap node `ceph1`, enable the `ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms` and `rhceph-5-tools-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms` repositories:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
subscription-manager repos --enable="ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms" --enable="rhceph-5-tools-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
....
--
+
. In all our RHCS hosts, we configure the hostname using the bare/short hostname.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
hostnamectl set-hostname <short_name>
....
--
+
. Verify the hostname configuration for deploying Red Hat Ceph Storage with cephadm.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
hostname
....

.Example output.
....
ceph1
....
--
+
. Check the long hostname with the fqdn using the hostname -f option.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
hostname -f
....

.Example output.
....
ceph1.bkgzv.sandbox762.opentlc.com
....
--
+
. Install the `cephadm-ansible` RPM package:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
sudo dnf install -y cephadm-ansible
....


IMPORTANT: To run the ansible playbooks, you must have ssh passwordless access
to all the nodes that are part of the Red Hat Ceph Storage cluster.
Ensure that the configured user (in our example, deployment-user) has
privileges to invoke the `sudo` command without needing a password.
--
+
. Configure the selected user, in our case `deployment-user` ssh config file to specify the user and id/key that can be used for connecting to the nodes via ssh:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]

....
cat <<EOF > ~/.ssh/config
Host ceph*
   User deployment-user
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ceph.pem
EOF
....
--
+
. Build our ansible inventory
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
cat <<EOF > /usr/share/cephadm-ansible/inventory
ceph1 
ceph2
ceph3
ceph4 
ceph5
ceph6
ceph7
[admin]
ceph1
EOF
....


NOTE: Hosts configured as part of the [admin] group on the inventory file will be
tagged as _admin by cephadm, so they receive the admin ceph keyring during
the bootstrap process 

--
+
. Verify that ansible can access all nodes using the ping module before running the pre-flight playbook.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ansible -i /usr/share/cephadm-ansible/inventory -m ping all -b
....
.Example output.
....
ceph6 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph4 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph3 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph5 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph7 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
....

--
+
. The pre-flight Ansible playbook configures the Ceph repository and prepares the storage cluster for bootstrapping. It also installs some prerequisites, such as podman, lvm2, chronyd, and cephadm. The default location for cephadm-ansible and cephadm-preflight.yml is /usr/share/cephadm-ansible. 
+
Run the following ansible-playbook.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ansible-playbook -i /usr/share/cephadm-ansible/inventory /usr/share/cephadm-ansible/cephadm-preflight.yml --extra-vars "ceph_origin=rhcs"
....
--

== Cluster Bootstrapping and service deployment with Cephadm

The cephadm utility installs and starts a single Ceph Monitor daemon and a Ceph Manager daemon for a new Red Hat Ceph Storage cluster on the local node where the cephadm bootstrap command is run.

NOTE: For additional information on the bootstrapping process, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html/installation_guide/red-hat-ceph-storage-installation#bootstrapping-a-new-storage-cluster_install[Bootstrapping
a new storage cluster.]

In this example, with the bootstrap command we will use a service specification file called
cluster-spec.yaml to deploy the remaining 6 Nodes into the RHCS cluster and
also configure the following RHCS services:

* `Ceph cluster Monitors(MONs) and Managers(MGRs)`

Using the spec file in this example, five monitors will get deployed and they will
get allocated according to the labels we have specified on each node.

Two managers will get deployed in Active/Passive fashion, Each Manager daemon
will be allocated to a different datacenter.

NOTE: For additional information on configuring Monitors using the service specification file.
See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html-single/operations_guide/index#deploying-the-ceph-monitor-daemons-using-the-service-specification_ops[Configure MONs
service using service specification file.]


* `Object Storage Devices (OSDs)`

Using the spec file in this example, all free disks on the nodes will be used as
osds, in this example we have one driver per node, so 7 OSDs will be created, one per each ceph host where ceph7 is the arbiter node which does not have any OSD’s configured.

NOTE: For additional information on configuring OSDs using the service specification file.
See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html-single/operations_guide/index#advanced-service-specifications-and-filters-for-deploying-osds_ops[Configure OSD Advanced filters.]

* `Metadata Services (MDS) required for CephFS`

Using the spec file in this example 2 MDS servers will be deployed in
Active/Passive, each MDS service will allocated to a different site.

NOTE: For additional information on the MDS service spec configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html-single/operations_guide/index#deploying-the-mds-service-using-the-service-specification_ops[Configure MDS
service using service specification file.]

* `Rados Gateway Services(RGW) required for object storage`

Using the spec file in this example 2 RGW services will be deployed, listening on
port 8080, Will allocate each RGW service to a different datacenter.

NOTE: For additional information on the GRW service spec configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html-single/operations_guide/index#deploying-the-ceph-object-gateway-using-the-service-specification_ops[Configure RGW service using service specification file.]

NOTE: To know more about RGW, see

. Retrieve the IP for the NIC with the RHCS public network configured from the
bootstrap node. After substituting the `10.0.40.0` with the subnet you have defined in your ceph public network, you can use the following example command.
+
--

[source,role="execute"]
....
ip a | grep 10.0.40
....

Example output:

....
10.0.40.78
....
--
+
. Run the `Cephadm` bootstrap command as the root user on the node that will be the initial Monitor node in the cluster. The `IP_ADDRESS` option is the node's IP address that you are using to run the `cephadm bootstrap` command.
+
--
NOTE: If you have configured a different user than root for passwordless SSH
access, use the `--ssh-user=` flag with the cepadm bootstrap command


[source,role="execute"]
....
cephadm  bootstrap --ssh-user=deployment-user --mon-ip 10.0.40.78 --apply-spec /root/cluster-spec.yaml --registry-json /root/registry.json
....

IMPORTANT: If the local node uses fully-qualified domain names (FQDN), add the `--allow-fqdn-hostname` option to cephadm bootstrap on the command line.

Once the bootstrap finishes, you will see the following output from the previous cephadm bootstrap command:


[source,role="execute"]

== Configuring Red Hat Ceph Storage stretch cluster

`Procedure`

. Check the current election strategy the monitors use with the `ceph mon dump` command. By default in a ceph cluster, the connectivity is set to classic.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
$ ceph mon dump | grep election_strategy
....
.Example output.
....
dumped monmap epoch 9
election_strategy: 1
....
--
+
. Change the monitor election to connectivity.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph mon set election_strategy connectivity
....
--
+
. Run the previous ceph mon dump command again to verify the election_strategy value.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
$ ceph mon dump | grep election_strategy
....
.Example output.
....
dumped monmap epoch 10
election_strategy: 3
....


NOTE: To know more about the different election strategies, see

monitor election strategy.]
--
+
. Set the location for all our Ceph monitors:
+
--

[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph mon set_location ceph1 datacenter=DC1
ceph mon set_location ceph2 datacenter=DC1
ceph mon set_location ceph4 datacenter=DC2
ceph mon set_location ceph5 datacenter=DC2
ceph mon set_location ceph7 datacenter=DC3
....
--
+
. Verify that each monitor has its appropriate location.
+
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph mon dump
....
+
.Example output.

....
+
+
. Create a CRUSH rule that makes use of the OSD crush topology by installing the ceph-base RPM package in order to use the crushtool command:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
dnf -y install ceph-base
....

To know more about CRUSH ruleset, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5/html/architecture_guide/the-core-ceph-components#ceph-crush-ruleset_arch[Ceph
CRUSH ruleset.]
--
+
. Get the compiled CRUSH map from the cluster:
+
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph osd getcrushmap > /etc/ceph/crushmap.bin
....
+
. Decompile the CRUSH map and convert it to a text file in order to be able to edit it:
+
[source,role="execute"]
....
crushtool -d /etc/ceph/crushmap.bin -o /etc/ceph/crushmap.txt
....
+
. Add the following rule to the CRUSH map by editing the text file /etc/ceph/crushmap.txt at the end of the file. 
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....

vim /etc/ceph/crushmap.txt

...
rule stretch_rule {
        id 1
        type replicated
        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take DC1
        step chooseleaf firstn 2 type host
        step emit
        step take DC2
        step chooseleaf firstn 2 type host
        step emit
}

# end crush map
....

[NOTE]
====
The rule `id` has to be unique in our case we only have one more crush rule with
id 0 that is why we are using id 1, if your deployment has more rules created,
please use the next free id.
====

The CRUSH rule we have declared contains the following information:

* `Rule name`:
** Description: A unique whole name for identifying the rule.
** Value: `stretch_rule`
* `id`:
** Description: A unique whole number for identifying the rule.
** Value: `1`
* `type`:
** Description: Describes a rule for either a storage drive replicated or erasure-coded.
** Value: `replicated`
* `min_size`:
** Description: If a pool makes fewer replicas than this number, CRUSH will not select this rule.
** Value: `1`
* `max_size`:
** Description: If a pool makes more replicas than this number, CRUSH will not select this rule.
** Value: `10`
* `step take DC1`
** Description: Takes a bucket name (DC1), and begins iterating down the tree.
* `step chooseleaf firstn 2 type host`
** Description: Selects the number of buckets of the given type, in this case is two different hosts located in DC1.
* `step emit`
** Description: Outputs the current value and empties the stack. Typically used at the end of a rule, but may also be used to pick from different trees in the same rule.
* `step take DC2`
** Description: Takes a bucket name (DC2), and begins iterating down the tree.
* `step chooseleaf firstn 2 type host`
** Description: Selects the number of buckets of the given type, in this case, is two different hosts located in DC2.
* `step emit`
** Description: Outputs the current value and empties the stack. Typically used at the end of a rule, but may also be used to pick from different trees in the same rule.

. Compile the new CRUSH map from the file /etc/ceph/crushmap.txt and convert it to a binary file called /etc/ceph/crushmap2.bin:
+
[source,role="execute"]
....
crushtool -c /etc/ceph/crushmap.txt -o /etc/ceph/crushmap2.bin
....
+
. Inject the new crushmap we created back into the cluster:
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph osd setcrushmap -i /etc/ceph/crushmap2.bin
....

.Example output.
....
17
....

NOTE: The number 17 is a counter and it will increase (18,19, and so on) depending on the changes you make to the crush map
--
+
. Verify that the stretched rule created is now available for use.
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph osd crush rule ls
....

.Example output.
....
replicated_rule
stretch_rule
....
--
+
. Enable stretch cluster mode
+
--
[source,role="execute"]
....
ceph mon enable_stretch_mode ceph7 stretch_rule datacenter
....

In this example, `ceph7` is the arbiter node, `stretch_rule` is the crush rule we created in the previous step and `datacenter` is the dividing bucket.

Verify all our pools are using the `stretch_rule` CRUSH rule we have created in our Ceph cluster:

[source,role="execute"]
....
for pool in $(rados lspools);do echo -n "Pool: ${pool}; ";ceph osd pool get ${pool} crush_rule;done
....

.Example output.
....
Pool: device_health_metrics; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: cephfs.cephfs.meta; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: cephfs.cephfs.data; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: .rgw.root; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: default.rgw.log; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: default.rgw.control; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: default.rgw.meta; crush_rule: stretch_rule
Pool: rbdpool; crush_rule: stretch_rule
....

This indicates that a working Red Hat Ceph Storage stretched cluster with  arbiter mode is now available.
